    <h1>How to Make Fried Rice + 5 Easy Fried Rice Recipes</h1>
    <p>You don’t have to wait until the family wants to order takeout to enjoy a heaping bowl of fried rice. Offering maximum flavor with minimal fuss, fried rice is surprisingly simple to whip up, a great way to use up leftovers and, best of all, comes together in a single pan. Read on for cooking tips, watch an easy-to-follow video and then test your skills with some of our best fried rice recipes for beginners and experts alike.</p>
    <h2>What are the Ingredients in Fried Rice?</h2>
    <p>Though it was first developed during the Sui Dynasty (581-618 CE) in China as a culinary solution to using up leftovers and avoiding waste, fried rice has since become a popular dish worldwide due to its simple preparation and delicious flavor. Many countries have since adopted it, resulting in endless variations and influences. One of our favorite things about fried rice is that you really only need two ingredients: rice and oil. Still, there are a few other items that are often included when you order fried rice at a restaurant. Let’s go over the usual components and how to incorporate them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice: Though we’d suggest using a long-grain rice if you have it, you can make fried rice with any length grain. The key to finding the perfect texture is to use leftover or cold rice, which gets crispier than freshly cooked rice.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: Traditional veggies include onion, carrots and peas, but feel free to add anything you have on-hand that you think will work. Cut the veggies into fairly small pieces before adding them to your pan.</li>
            <li>Eggs: The egg should be added after the vegetables but before the rice. Slide the veggies to one side of the pan, then scramble the eggs on the other.</li>
            <li>Sesame oil: Don’t skip this one! Sesame oil, which has a distinctive nutty aroma, is essential to achieving an authentic flavor.</li>
            <li>Soy sauce: When adding sauce, remember to start slow—you can always add more later, if needed</li>
            <li>Green onion: Though not essential, green onions are a common garnish and add a nice brightness to the final dish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>How Do You Make Simple Fried Rice?</h2>
    <p>When it comes to uncomplicated dinners, fried rice is about as easy as it gets, and it’s infinitely versatile. Let’s quickly go over how to make fried rice with a basic vegetable fried rice recipe:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your wok or skillet to medium-high heat. Pour in the oil. Cook the vegetables until tender, then slide them to the side and add an egg or two to the empty section of the pan.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, scramble the eggs then mix them with the veggies.</li>
            <li>Finally, stir in the rice and a bit of soy sauce. Serve warm and refrigerate leftovers.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can begin to incorporate any other ingredients or flavors you may want to add.</p>
