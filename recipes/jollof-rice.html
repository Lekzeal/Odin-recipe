                <ul>
                    <li>Pour the rinsed rice into the pot, stirring it into the tomato sauce until well coated.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken broth (or water) and mix thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the liquid level is just above the rice. Add more water or broth if needed.</li>
                </ul><br>
