    <h1>Simple Ogbono soup</h1>
    <p>Ogbono soup is a go-to Nigerian gooey soup made from dried Bush mango seeds. A lot of people may love Ogbono soup, but one mistake in the preparation could turn it to a mess. Here is my simple preparation method</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups blended dried Ogbono</li>
            <li>500 g beef</li>
            <li>500 g tripe</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized dried fish or stockfish</li>
            <li>1/2 cup palm oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons blended crayfish</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon blended pepper</li>
            <li>1 small red onion</li>
            <li>2 Knorr cubes</li>
            <li>1 handful uziza leaves (or Ugu leaves)</li>
        </ul>
